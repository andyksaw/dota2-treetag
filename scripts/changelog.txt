TO FIX:
- XP table is incorrect
- 0/0 hp wisp at centre of map
- Add levels to Ensnare
- Add levels to Flames of Speed
- Add levels to Slam Ground
- Multiplayer: Treants all dead = no win condition triggered
- Multiplayer: Check that Invisible Trees are actually invisible
- Buildings are practically invincible while being built due to percentage hp add
- Reconnect: playerID needs to be relinked with their Treant table counterpart
- Fix spawn points (currently spawns from dota_start because team is unassigned)
